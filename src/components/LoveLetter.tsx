              No matter where life takes us, through every season and every change,
              my promises will always stay with you. They're not just words written
              on this page — they're carved into my heart, woven into every moment
              we share.
            </p>
            <p className="letter-text">
              You are my today, my tomorrow, and all the beautiful days in between.
              Every promise I make to you is a promise I make to myself — to be
              the person worthy of your love, to build a life that honors what we have.
            </p>
            <p className="letter-text">
              Thank you for being my forever.
            </p>

              Forever yours 🤍
